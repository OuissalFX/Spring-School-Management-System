# Spring-School-Management-System

This is a simple school management system created using **SPRING BOOT**, **SPRING MVC**, **SPRING SECURITY** and **THYEMELEAF**. This project is mainly aimed at Spring framework beginners, myself included, to get used to its applications. 
It is still an ongoing project, so many features will be added in the near future.
