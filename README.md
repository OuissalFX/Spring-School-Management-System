# Spring-School-Management-System

This is a simple school management system created using **SPRING BOOT**, **SPRING MVC**, **SPRING SECURITY** and **THYEMELEAF**. The main purpose of this project is to help Spring framework beginners to get used to its manipulations. 
It is still an ongoing project, so many features will be added in the near future.
